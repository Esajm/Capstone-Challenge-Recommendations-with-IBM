# Capstone Challenge Recommendations with IBM Watson

### Overview
- This Capstone project is a practical implemention of what I have learned in Data Science Udacity course to build Recommender System for IBM Watson community. This recommendation system suggests articles for users to interact

### Features (The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways)

- Collaborative Filtering
  - Takes into account the similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users. This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).
- Rank-Based Recommendations
  - Recommends the highest ranked articles starting with the most highly ranked
- SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations
  - Utilises matrix operations to predict the ranking

### Project Overview
  - I am aiming by the end of this code to answer 3 questions:
    - The 7 most similar users to a particular user?
    - What to recommend for a new user?
    - What are the top 7 articles to recommend for an existing user?
    
### Approach to Answer th question
  - Data Exploration
  - Cleaning the data
  - Build recommendation systems 
  
### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available on this link (https://data-science-blog.blogspot.com/2020/02/makkah-weather.html).
