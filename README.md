# Capstone Challenge Recommendations with IBM Watson

### Overview
- This Capstone project is a practical implemention of what I have learned in Data Science Udacity course to build Recommender System for IBM Watson community. This recommendation system suggests articles for users to interact

### Features (The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways)

- Collaborative Filtering
  - Takes into account the similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users
- Rank-Based Recommendations
  - Recommends the highest ranked articles starting with the most highly ranked
- SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations
  - Utilises matrix operations to predict the ranking
